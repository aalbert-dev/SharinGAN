# SharinGAN
Official repo for the work titled "SharinGAN: Combining Synthetic and Real Data for Unsupervised GeometryEstimation"

The official project website for this work can be found <a href="https://koutilya-pnvr.github.io/SharinGAN/">here</a>.

We added the training and validation codes for both the tasks of Monocular Depth Estimation and Face Normal Estimation. We hope to improve the repository with time. We appreciate your inputs and feedback

The trained model for the monocular depth estimation task is availabe <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13fu5SMRQxRGpsMJUmhRv3haAKmi__ofR/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
