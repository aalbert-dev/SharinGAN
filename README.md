# SharinGAN
Official repo for the work titled "SharinGAN: Combining Synthetic and Real Data for Unsupervised GeometryEstimation"

The official project website for this work can be found <a href="https://koutilya-pnvr.github.io/SharinGAN/">here</a>.

We added the training and validation codes for both the tasks of Monocular Depth Estimation and Face Normal Estimation. We hope to improve the repository with time. We appreciate your inputs and feedback

## Monocular Depth Estimation
The trained model for the monocular depth estimation task is availabe <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13fu5SMRQxRGpsMJUmhRv3haAKmi__ofR/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

The dataset files required for the Kitti_dataloader.py and VKitti_dataloader.py are made available at Monocular_Depth_Estimation/dataset_files/.

Place the Kitti/.txt files in the original downloaded kitti/ dataset folder. Similarly place the VKitti/.txt files in the original downloaded Virtual_Kitti/ dataset folder.
